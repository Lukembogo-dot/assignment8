# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

## Project Description:
The COVID-19 Global Data Tracker is a Python-based tool designed to track the COVID-19 pandemic globally. It collects real-time data from various APIs, visualizes trends, and provides insights into case statistics, recovery rates, and mortality rates.

## Objectives:
- To track global COVID-19 cases and their trends.
- To visualize data using charts and graphs.
- To generate insights from the collected data, such as the most affected countries.

## Tools & Libraries Used:
- **Python**: Primary programming language.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Requests**: To fetch real-time data from APIs.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive data analysis.

## How to Run/View the Project:
1. Clone the repository:  
   `https://github.com/Lukembogo-dot/assignment8.git`
2. Navigate to the project folder:  
   `https://github.com/Lukembogo-dot/assignment8/blob/050b44b917d6ef9d6f7d158a8aad6c30e4c9d775/COVID-19.ipynb`
3. Install dependencies:  
   `pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn requests`
4. Run the project:  
   Open the `COVID-19.ipynb` to start tracking the COVID-19 data.

## Insights/Reflections:
This project gave me a deeper understanding of working with APIs and real-time data. I was able to explore how data visualization can help interpret complex information like pandemic trends.
